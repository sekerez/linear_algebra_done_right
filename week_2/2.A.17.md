Problem:
Suppose $ A = p_0, p_1, ..., p_m $ are polynomials in $ P_m (F) $ such that $ p_j (2) = 0 $ for each $ j $. 
Prove that $ A $ is not linearly independent in $ P_m (F) $.

Proof:

1. No list of length $ m+1 $ with elements in $ P_m (F) $ can be linearly independent unless it spans $ P_m (F) $.

The only linearly independent list of length $ m + 1 $ with elements in $ P_m (F) $ is the list of polynomials $ q_0, q_1, ..., q_m $ which, when sorted in ascending degree, has its degree match its (0-indexed) position. That this list spans $ P_m (F) $ is easy to show. The harder part is showing that no other list of the same length is linearly independent in $ P_m (F) $.

Consider two polinomials of the same degree: $ q_0 (z) = a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_m z ^ m $ and $ q_1 (z) = b_0 + b_1 z + ... + b_m z ^ m $. These polynomials cannot be linearly independent. Their linear combination with coefficients $ c_0, c_1 $, resulting in the polynomial $ q_2 $, is then the following:

$$
q_2 (z) = c_0 (a_0 + a_1 z + ... + a_m z ^ m) + c_1 (b_0 + b_1 z + ... + b_m z ^ m)
$$
$$
q_2 (z) = (c_0 a_0 + c_ 0 a_1 z + ... + c_0 a_m z ^ m) + (c_1 b_0 + c_1 b_1 z + ... + c_1 b_m z ^ m)
$$
$$
q_2 (z) = (c_0 a_0 + c_1 b_0) + z (c_0 a_1 + c_1 b_1) + ... + z ^ m ( c_0 a_m + c_1 b_m) 
$$

By definition, $ a_m \neq 0 \land b_m \neq 0 $, so it's not hard to see that $ \forall a_m, a_b \in F . (a_m \neq 0, b_m \neq 0) \to \exists c_0, c_1 \in F . (c_0 \neq 0 \lor c_1 \neq 0) \land c_0 a_m + c_1 b_m = 0 $. Hence two polynomials with the same degree can never be linearly independent. 

Because of that, if a list of length $ m + 1 $ is linearly independent, then all its elements must have different degrees. If the maximum degree is $ m $, then the only such list is the one described above, which spans $ P_m (F) $.

2. $ A $, of length $ m + 1 $ and with members in $ P_m (F) $, doesn't span $ P_m (F) $.

Consider a polinomial $ q \in P_m (F) $ such that $ q(2) \neq 0 $ (say, $ q(2) = b $ where $ b \neq 0 $). What linear combination of $ A $ could result in such a polynomial? In other words, are there coefficients in $ F $ such that $ a_0 p_0 + ... + a_m p_m = q$ ?

Because addition in the vector space $ P (F) $ (of which $ P_m (F) $ is a subspace) is defined as $ \forall p,q \in P_m (F) \land \forall z \in F . (p + q) (z) = p(z) + q(z) $, and scalar multiplication is defined as $ \forall \lambda \in F . (\lambda p) (z) = \lambda (p(z)) $, then there must be coefficients in $ F $ such that:
$$
a_0 (p_0 (2) = 0) + a_1 (p_1 (2) = 0) + a_m (p_m (2) = 0) = (q (2) = b)
$$
$$
a_0 (0) + a_1 (0) + ... + a_m (0) = b
$$
$$
0 = b
$$
This contradicts the assumption that $ b \neq 0 $, hence $ q $ is not a linear combination of $ A $, hence $ A $ doesn't span $ P_m (F) $.

Conclusion: since A doesn't span $ P_m (F) $, and any list of length $ m + 1 $ that is linearly independent spans $ P_m (F) $, then A is not linearly independent.
